This is my attempt at a hack for http://stockholm.musichackday.org

The wiki page about our hack is here: http://stockholm.musichackday.org/index.php?page=ProximRadio+-+Blobble+-+Blobbler

Instructions:
Sign in with your Last.fm details on the settings tab.

Play you personal Last.fm library on the radio tab.

If a bluetooth device is found with a device name in the format lfm-<Last.fm username>, PresentRadio will be retuned to be a combination of your Last.fm libraries.  Everyone listening to the radio is happy!

Note:
PresentRadio will only build on Mac OSX at the moment, mainly because of the bluetooth APIs, but I'll see if I can get it running on windows later.

This project uses:
liblastfm - for playing Last.fm radio and scrobbling.
qjson http://qjson.sourceforge.net/ - for parsing the json response from Echonest's alpha_search_tracks.
The apple bluetooth framework.
